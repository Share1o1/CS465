Architecture
The project used Express HTML (server-rendered pages with templating) for simple content delivery and SPA (Angular) for dynamic admin interfaces. Express handles full page reloads, while Angular enables client-side routing and real-time updates. MongoDB (NoSQL) was chosen for its flexibility in storing unstructured data (e.g., trip details) and scalability for future feature expansion.

Functionality

JSON is a data format (not a language) used to serialize data between frontend/backend (e.g., API responses).

Refactoring: Reusable Angular components (e.g., forms) reduced redundancy, while services centralized API calls, improving maintainability.

Testing

Methods/Endpoints: Tools like Postman tested CRUD endpoints (e.g., GET /api/trips). Unit/E2E tests validated UI-API integration.

Security: Implemented CORS, JWT authentication, and input validation to protect endpoints from misuse.

Reflection
This course strengthened my skills in VS Code, REST APIs, MongoDB, and testing, directly aligning with industry demands for full-stack roles.
